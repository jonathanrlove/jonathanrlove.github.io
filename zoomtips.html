        <h2 id="writesharemath">Writing and Sharing Math</h2>
        
        <h3 id="physical">Physical Chalkboard or Whiteboard</h3>
        If you have access to a chalkboard or whiteboard, you can simply
        point the camera at it. Check ahead of time what portion of the
        board is visible (so you don't write things out of view of the 
        camera), and make sure you write large and dark enough so that 
        your writing is legible to people only seeing the screen.
        
        <h3 id="paper">Paper on the wall</h3>
        If you don't have a whiteboard or chalkboard, you can tape or tack
        pieces of paper to the wall and write on them with marker. Be
        prepared to change the paper often, as it will likely fill up 
        extremely fast (you will need to write fairly large in order for
        it to be legible.)
        
        <h3 id="prepared">Prepared Slides or Documents</h3>
        This is less ideal if you will need to be explaining things on
        the fly, but if you know in advance what you will be covering
        (e.g. you can write up solutions ahead of time), you can include
        the math in a Beamer presentation, PDF, or otherwise. This may 
        be TeXed or handwritten and scanned.<br><br>

        The file can then either be shared
        <ul>
            <li> By sending a link to all participants (e.g. using the Zoom 
                chat feature), or
            </li>
            <li> by opening it on your own computer and sharing sceen 
                (from the call, click "Share," choose the open window with
                the relevant math, then click "Share.") With this option, 
                a menu option "Annotate" appears, which allows you to 
                write directly on the file.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="livetex">Live TeXing</h3>
        Similar to Prepared slides or documents, but allowing you to present 
        math in real time. As with prepared files, this can be done in multiple ways:
        <ul>
            <li> Send a link to a shared <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/project">
                Overleaf project</a> through the Zoom chat, so that everyone can have
                it open on their screens; as you type out and explain what you're typing,
                students can Recompile the document and see what you've written.
            </li>
            <li> Use your favorite TeX editor, and share your screen 
                (from the call, click "Share," choose the TeX editor, then click "Share.")
                Remember to recompile often, and make sure text is in a large font (e.g. use
                 \begin{Large}\end{Large}).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="virtwhiteboard">Virtual whiteboard</h3>
        As a host of a Zoom call, press "Share," click "Whiteboard," then
        press "Share." A large blank screen will appear on your device, which
        you can draw on using your mouse; if your computer has a touchscreen
        and/or a stylus, you may use that as well.<br><br>

        (Note: if you move your mouse to the top of the screen, a menu of options
        should come down. If you click on "More" you will see an option to
        enable or disable participant annotations, in case you want participants
        to be able to draw on the board as well.)
        <br><br>
        (You may also use Notability, or screen share with another drawing 
        app of your choice)
        
        <h3 id="ipad">Pairing with an iPad</h3>
        If you want to use your computer for the camera and microphone, but 
        an iPad for the shared whiteboard, <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-iOS-Screen-Sharing-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client">
        see the instructions here</a>. <br><br>

        Warning: If you do not have an iPhone or iPad to pair with, choosing
                this option may make your call stop responding.
        
        <h3 id="multipledevice">Calling from multiple devices</h3>
        Zoom allows you to log in to your account from <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000787483-Can-I-use-Zoom-on-multiple-devices-">
        one computer, one tablet, and one phone</a>. You can then join the call 
        from multiple devices. This is ideal if you want to use a tablet
        that is not an iPad, or if you want to manage the call using your
        phone/tablet and use your computer for the shared whiteboard.<br><br>

        Warnings:
        <ul>
            <li> Make sure that the sound on all but one of your devices
                is turned off to avoid feedback. (It is not enough to just
                mute the device on Zoom, as it will still play sound which
                the other device's microphone will pick up.)
            </li>
            <li> Zoom Polling does not work if the host has multiple devices
                in the same call.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="drawtablet">Using a Drawing Tablet</h3>

        There are tablets that are meant to be used as inputs for a computer
        rather than stand-alone devices; see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Drawing-Software-Included-CTL4100/dp/B079HL9YSF/">
        an example</a>. If you make a Zoom call from your computer, you can 
        then use this device with Zoom's <a href="#virtwhiteboard">shared whiteboard</a>
        or for <a href="#prepared">annotating documents on a shared screen</a>.<br><br>

        <small>(suggested by Beatrice Chetard, communicated to me by Christine Taylor)</small>

        <h3 id="doccam">Makeshift Document Camera</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up a large stack of books or boxes (approximately 30 cm high) next
                to a sheet of paper. </li>
            <li>Use your phone in the Zoom call, and put the camera into landscape
                mode (make sure that screen rotation is unlocked and turn your phone
                horizontally). </li>
            <li>Use your phone in the Zoom call, and put the camera into landscape
                mode (make sure that screen rotation is unlocked and turn your phone
                horizontally). </li>
            <li>Balance the phone on the top of the books (another book
                on top can help keep it in place) with the camera sticking out over
                the pad of paper.</li>
        </ol>
        Since the camera is so close to the paper in this case, it may 
        be possible to write at a fairly normal size; however, you should 
        still use a marker, or at least a pen with a thick dark stroke.
        
        <h2 id="manageofficehours">Managing Office Hours</h2>
        
        <h3 id="ohscheduling">Scheduling</h3>

        <b>Schedule Office Hours using Canvas:</b> from the course page, click "Zoom,"
        then "Schedule a New Meeting." You can use the "Recurring Meeting" checkbox 
        to schedule weekly sessions. <br><br>

        <b>Do <i>not</i> record Office Hours,</b> in order to ensure
        students feel comfortable asking any questions. When you are 
        setting up the meeting, ensure that "Record the meeting automatically"
        is <i>not</i> checked.
        <br><br>

        <b>Keep time zones in mind;</b> if all available office hours fall within a given
        8-hour window, then there will most likely be students who can't attend any
        of the scheduled times without losing sleep. If possible, schedule at least one set of
        office hours early in the morning (better for students in Europe, Africa,
        the Middle East, Central/South Asia) as well as one later in the evening (better for students
        in East Asia and the Pacific).<br><br>

        When it's time to hold office hours, go to Canvas > Zoom, and click the 
        "Start" button next to the relevant meeting.
        <b>Do not start a new meeting directly from the Zoom app.</b> 

        <h3 id="waitroom">Waiting Room</h3>
        If you ever need to talk to a student or group of students privately
        (e.g. they come to office hours and want to discuss their grades), 
        you can <b>set up a waiting room</b> for everyone else. Here are <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room?mobile_site=true">
        instructions for how to enable and use the waiting room feature</a> (this
        needs to be done before you start the call). 
        <br><br>
        Note: for Stanford affiliates, in Step 1 you should go to <a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/profile/settings">https://stanford.zoom.us/profile/settings</a> 

        <h3 id="genfeedback">Getting Feedback</h3>
        If office hours are busy, you may want to be able to get a general sense 
        of what students want; for instance, which problems the most students 
        want to discuss. There are a few options.
        <ul>
            <li>Have students <b>type in their questions into the Zoom Chat</b>.
                Simple, but questions can get lost easily if there are too many.
            </li>
            <li><b><a href="#tapolling">Set up a poll</a></b> with a list of problems, 
                and have 
                participants vote on which problems they want to go over 
                (you can set up the poll 
                so that students can choose multiple answers).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="managetasession">Managing TA Sessions</h2>
        
        <h3 id="tagensugg">General Suggestions</h3>

        <b>Schedule Office Hours using Canvas:</b> from the course page, click "Zoom,"
        then "Schedule a New Meeting." You can use the "Recurring Meeting" checkbox 
        to schedule weekly sessions.<br><br> 

        <b><i>Do</i> record TA sessions,</b> in order to ensure
        that all students can learn from them, even if they are not
        available at the scheduled time. When setting up the Zoom meeting,
        check "Record the meeting automatically."<br><br>

        When it's time to run the TA Session, go to Canvas > Zoom, and click the 
        "Start" button next to the relevant meeting.
        <b>Do not start a new meeting directly from the Zoom app.</b> 

        <h3 id="tapolling">Polling</h3>
        A good way to ask questions to everyone and to get feedback 
        from students. See instructions for how
        to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings">
            use polls in Zoom</a>. 
            
            <br><br>
            Warning: Polling in Zoom is not completely intuitive, and 
            can sometimes behave strangely (for instance, unlike many other Zoom
            features, only the person who started the call may use polling; one 
            can't transfer the ability to run polls to a new host. Also, if the 
            host enters the call with multiple devices, polling is disabled.) 
       
            <br><br>
            An alternative polling software to consider is <a href="https://www.polleverywhere.com/">
            Poll Everywhere.</a>

        <h3 id="breakoutrooms">Breakout Rooms</h3>
        If you want to divide students into small groups to discuss problems
        before coming back to go over solutions, you can use <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Video-Breakout-Rooms">
        Breakout rooms</a>.<br><br>
        
        Sample use case:
        <ol>
            <li>State a problem that you want the students to work on.</li>
            <li>Give students a minute or two to think about the problem on their
                own. In this time, start setting up: click "Breakout Rooms," choose
                an appropriate number of rooms to create, make sure "Automatically" is 
                selected, and click "Create Rooms." (This will not open the rooms yet;
                you will have the opportunity to reassign students to different rooms
                 if you wish.)</li>
            <li>Say something along these lines: "I'll now be assigning you to groups 
                of 3-4 to discuss your work on this problem. You can use the Share Whiteboard
                feature to communicate written work. Make sure to discuss what 
                techniques or strategies you use in your solution. You'll have seven 
                minutes, and then we'll come back to the full group to discuss. 
                Until then, you can click the "Ask for Help" button if you have any questions."</li>
            <li>Click "Open All Rooms." Students will be assigned to breakout rooms
                once they click "Join."
            </li>
            <li>From the Breakout Rooms dialog box:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can Join individual breakout rooms by
                        clicking "Join."</li>
                    <li>If someone in a breakout room clicks "Ask for Help," you will be
                        shown an alert.</li>
                    <li>You can "Broadcast a message to all" (e.g. a correction or clarification,
                        or reminder of how much time is remaining) and it will appear on their screens.</li>
                </ul>   
            </li>
            <li>When you click "Close All Rooms," students will have 60 seconds to finish
                their discussions and save their work before returning to the large group.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        As a host, you can send announcements to all rooms
        (e.g. "five minutes left!" or corrections/clarifications), and you
        can join individual rooms to see how they're doing. Participants 
        can ask for help, and you will be notified.

        <h3 id="collwhiteboard">Collaborative Whiteboard</h3>
        <a href="#virtwhiteboard">Shared Whiteboards</a> can be used by
        all participants. Each Breakout Room can also get its own shared
        whiteboard, giving small groups a common workspace.
        <br><br>
        Note: shared Zoom whiteboards in breakout rooms are not automatically
        saved when the breakout rooms close. This should be fine for most
        use cases (a screenshot can still be saved, they just won't be able to keep
        writing on it), but if you want a shared whiteboard that small groups can
        go back to and keep editing, consider <a href="https://explaineverything.com/">
        Explain Everything</a>.
